## Purpose
Brypt is an exploration into creating a secure distributed network and application protocol that is agnostic of communication technology. The prevalence of devices deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) networks has exploded in the past decade, entering into many different industries and applications. The exploitation of an IoT network's unsecured communications can have wide-reaching consequences for the privacy of environmental and user data. This project will implement a solution for these IoT use cases by developing a secured network organized into a pseudo-mesh topology while utilizing lightweight cryptographic primitives to maintain privacy, efficiency, and graceful degradation. The metrics produced by the Brypt ecosystem will be used to investigate the computational and power impacts of different cryptographic systems.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
#### C++ Standard Version: C++20
#### Build Tools:
- GCC/G++ 10.1.0
- GNU Make 4.1
- CMake 3.19
#### Library Dependencies
- Boost 1.75
- liboqs 0.3.0
- liboqs-cpp 0.3.0
- lithium_json 0.0
- Google Test 1.10
- spdlog 1.8.2
  
### Build Process
The build process is setup through the use of CMake. Currently, only g++-10 is supported. The codebase may be built for release with the following command:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make -j4
```
#### CMake Options
| Option | Value | Default | Required | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE | String | Release | No | Sets the type of symbols generated by the build process. With a value of "Release" the binaries are built as it would be for production. With a value of "Debug" the binaries are built with debug symbols and optimizations disabled. |

## Usage
### Running the Node
```bash
./bin/brypt
./bin/brypt --verbosity=debug --config=alpha.json --peers.json=alpha-peers.json
```
#### Command Line Arguments
For a full set of arguments run:
```bash
./bin/brypt --help
```
### Running the Tests
```bash
make test
```
